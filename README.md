### Setup Project

On the root level:

```bash
yarn install
```

Start development mode:

```bash
yarn dev:
```

> **Note** for the project to work you'll need to make sure to copy the the contents of `.env.example` in the root folder to a newly created `.env` file and adjust the values accordingly to your bot setup.
